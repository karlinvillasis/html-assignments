<h2>About Me</h2>
<body>
    <p>I am <strong>Karlin Villasis</strong>, a multimedia editor from the Philippines and a current Interactive Media Design student at Algonquin College. I like working with multimedia because it never gets boring because I get to work with many different things all the time. My favorite things to work on are videos, graphic design, and branding.
    <br>
    <br>
    Outside of work, I like watching films, cooking, and painting. Films are my reliable escape from the daily humdrum, while cooking and painting are like therapy for me. My goal someday is to move to a cabin overlooking the nature and do art and cook for my loved ones.

        Whenever I feel bad, I use that feeling to motivate me to work harder. I only allow myself one day to feel sorry for myself.
