<h2>About Me</h2>
<body>
    <p>
        I am <strong>Karlin Villasis</strong>, a multimedia editor from the Philippines and a current Interactive Media Design student at Algonquin College. I like working with multimedia because it never gets boring because I get to work with many different things all the time. My favorite things to work on are videos, graphic design, and branding.
<br>
<br>
        Outside of work, I like watching films, <del>sleeping,</del> cooking, and painting. Films are my reliable escape from the daily humdrum, while cooking and painting are like therapy for me. <mark>My goal someday is to move to a cabin overlooking the nature and do art and cook for my loved ones.</mark>
    </p>

    <p>
        My hobbies include:
        <ul>
            <li>Painting</li>
            <li>Cooking</li>
            <li>Cooking</li>
            <li>Watching Movies</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <q>
        Whenever I feel bad, I use that feeling to motivate me to work harder. I only allow myself one day to feel sorry for myself.
